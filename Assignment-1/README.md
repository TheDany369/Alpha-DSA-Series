# Alpha DSA Series - Assignment 1 🚀  

Welcome to my **Assignment 1** submissions for the **Alpha DSA Series**. This repository contains solutions to various problems covered in the first assignment, implemented in **C++**.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This assignment includes solutions based on fundamental programming concepts such as:  
✔️ Basic Input/Output Operations  
✔️ Arithmetic Calculations  
✔️ Conditional Statements  
✔️ Simple Problem-Solving Techniques  

Each problem is solved in a **separate file**, following a clear and structured approach.

## 📂 Folder Structure  
Alpha-DSA-Series/ │── Assignment-1/ │ ├── Q1_add_2_no.cpp │ ├── Q2_Area_of_rect.cpp │ ├── Q3_Arithemetic.cpp │ ├── Q4_Simple_inter.cpp │ ├── Q5_Ascii_value.cpp │ ├── ... │ ├── Q22_giveoutput.cpp │ └── (More solutions...) │── README.md

Each `.cpp` file corresponds to an individual problem solution. The approach varies across problems—some use **functions**, while others are solved using **direct logic** or **loops**.

## ⚡ How to Run the Code  
To compile and run any `.cpp` file, use the following command in your terminal:  
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output && ./output

g++ Q1_add_2_no.cpp -o add && ./add
